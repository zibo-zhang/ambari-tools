# ATTENTION: If you would like to use this property, do manually execute titan-solr-connection.sh before build index.

# This file connects to HBase using a Zookeeper quorum
# (storage.hostname) consisting solely of localhost. It also
# connects to Solr running on localhost using Solr's HTTP API.
# Zookeeper, the HBase services, and Solr must already be
# running and available before starting JanusGraph with this file.

# The indexing backend used to extend and optimize Titan's query
# functionality. This setting is optional. Titan can use multiple
# heterogeneous index backends. Hence, this option can appear more than
# once, so long as the user-defined name between "index" and "backend" is
# unique among appearances.Similar to the storage backend, this should be
# set to one of Titan's built-in shorthand names for its standard index
# backends (shorthands: lucene, elasticsearch, es, solr) or to the full
# package and classname of a custom/third-party IndexProvider
# implementation.
